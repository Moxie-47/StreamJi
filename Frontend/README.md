# StreamJi

**StreamJi** is a modern, Indian-inspired video streaming platform built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. Inspired by YouTube, StreamJi lets users explore trending videos, search for content, watch videos in a dynamic player, and browse channels—all in a fast, responsive web app.

## 🚀 What is StreamJi?

StreamJi is a single-page web application that brings together video discovery, playback, and channel browsing in a seamless, user-friendly interface. The platform uses the YouTube Data API to fetch real video content, allowing users to:

- Browse trending and category-based videos
- Search for videos by keyword
- Watch videos with an integrated player
- View channel profiles and their videos
- Navigate easily with a sidebar and responsive design

## 🎯 Why did I build this project?

This project was created to deepen my skills in modern React development, including routing, state management, and API integration. I wanted to build a real-world, full-stack-feeling application that demonstrates how to connect a React frontend to a third-party API, manage complex UI state, and deliver a polished user experience. The Indian-themed branding ("Ji") gives the project a unique identity and local flavor.
